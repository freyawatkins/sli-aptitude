# Setup
```{r setup, include=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE)
```

## Load packages
```{r load_packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(here) # file organisation & folder location
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling & plotting
library(naniar) # dealing with missing values
library(PupillometryR) # raincloud plots
library(plotrix) # for calculating standard error
library(scales) # scales on plots
library(psych) # for factor analysis
```

### R / package versions used
```{r r_package_versions, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
R.Version() 
packageVersion('here')
packageVersion('tidyverse')
packageVersion('psych')
```

## Read in data
```{r read_in_data}
here::here()
apt <- read_csv(here("data", "2022-03-17_SLI_aptitude_data.csv"))
apt <- as_tibble(apt)
```

### Look at data
```{r look_at_data}
head(apt)
tail(apt)
names(apt)
summary(apt)
```

#### Summarise missingness
```{r}
apt %>% select(-session:-ppt, -comments) %>% 
  naniar::miss_var_summary() # data is in long format though

apt_wide <- apt %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = session, 
                     values_from = c(nback_lett:comments))

naniar::miss_var_summary(apt_wide)

vis_miss(apt) # visualise missingness
vis_miss(apt_wide) # visualise missingness
vis_miss(apt, cluster = TRUE) # arrange rows according to missingness

# Show missingness on a row by row basis i.e. by participant & session
gg_miss_case(apt)
```
Not all of the missingness is a problem, for some variables we did not plan to test on all participants

#### Test imputation
```{r}
# simple imputation of replacing all NAs with the mean of that column
imp_mean <- apt_wide %>% 
  bind_shadow(only_miss = TRUE) %>% 
  add_label_shadow() %>% 
  impute_mean_all()
# this keeps the mean of each variable the same (good) but decreases the variance (bad), increasing bias. this method also doesn't take into account other factors that could better predict more plausible values than just using the mean

library(simputation) 
# imp_lm <- imp_mean %>% impute_lm(Y ~ X1 + X2)
# not sure how to use this yet

# or use {mice}
library(mice)
md.pattern(apt_wide)

# impute variables using predictive mean matching (PMM)
#test_mice <- mice(apt_wide, m=5, maxit=50, meth='pmm', seed=500)
#imputed_mice <- mice(apt_wide, m=5, method = "pmm") 

# summary(imputed_mice) # check summary
#imputed_mice$imp  # check imputed values

# get back to completed data set
#completed_apt <- complete(imputed_mice)
#head(completed_apt)
# certain columns are not fully imputed because they are perfectly collinear with other columns. we can see which columms are collinear:
apt_wide_m <- select(apt_wide, nback_lett_1:mr3d_rt_3, 
                               mlat_raw_1:mlat_acc_3, 
                               grade_bsl_1:grade_terp_3)
apt_wide_m <- as.matrix(apt_wide_m)
#cor(apt_wide_m, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
#mice:::find.collinear(completed_apt)
#mice(pred = diag(ncol()))

#init = mice(apt_wide, maxit=0) 
#meth = init$method
#predM = init$predictorMatrix

# remove specific variable as a predictor for imputation
#predM[c("group")]=0

# or use k-nearest neighbor  imputation in {bnstruct}
```

### Convert variables   

Fix the variables that are character when they should be factor, or numeric:  
```{r convert_variables}
# convert session, group, ppt & status to factor
apt <- mutate(apt, across(c("session", "group", "ppt", "status"), factor))

# convert these character variables to numeric
apt <- mutate(apt, across(c("L1_bsl", "prior_BSL", "age_s1", "dspan_time",
                            "bis_tot", "bis_att","bis_mot", "bis_nplan", "summ",
                            "copy_sign", "copy_sign", "bsl_srt", "town_map",
                            "terp_b2e"), as.numeric))
```



Add speed-accuracy trade off-scores for mental rotation data:
```{r}
# Create function 'Balanced Integration Score' (speed accuracy trade-off score)
# (Liesefeld, Fu, & Zimmer, 2015; Liesefeld & Janczyk, in press)

BIS <- function(data) {
  n <- length(data$group)   # sample size to correct var()-function result (which uses n-1)
  srt <- sqrt( ((n-1)/n) * var(data$mean_rt_c) )  # sample standard deviation across all rts
  spc <- sqrt( ((n-1)/n) * var(data$pc) ) # sample standard deviation across all rts
  mrt <- mean(data$mean_rt_c)                      # mean across all rts
  mpc <- mean(data$pc)                             # mean across all pcs
  zrt <- (data$mean_rt_c-mrt)/srt                  # standardized rts
  zpc <- (data$pc-mpc)/spc                         # z-standardized pcs
  data$bis <- zpc - zrt                            # Balanced Integration Score
  
  return(data)             # return data.frame with added variable 'bis'
}

mean_rt_c <- apt$mr2d_rt 
pc <- apt$mr2d_acc
group <- apt$session
ppt <- apt$ppt
data <- data.frame(group,ppt,mean_rt_c,pc)
data <- data %>% drop_na() # remove NAs

( BIS_2DMR <- BIS(data) )

mean_rt_c <- apt$mr3d_rt 
pc <- apt$mr3d_acc
data <- data.frame(group,ppt,mean_rt_c,pc)
data <- data %>% drop_na() # remove NAs

( BIS_3DMR <- BIS(data) )
```

Rename levels of Session for tables/plotting:  
```{r relevel_session}
apt$session <- plyr::revalue(apt$session, c("1" = "pre-degree", 
                                            "2" = "1st year", 
                                            "3" = "2nd year",
                                            "4" = "3rd year"))
