# Setup
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, 
                      echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE) 
```

## Load packages
```{r load_packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(here) # file organisation & folder location
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling & plotting
library(scales) # scales on plots
library(lme4) # for linear mixed models
library(psych) # for factor analysis
```

### R / package versions used
```{r r_package_versions, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
R.Version() 
packageVersion('here')
packageVersion('tidyverse')
packageVersion('scales') 
packageVersion('lme4')

```

## Read pre-wrangled data 
(see `00-wrangling-setup.Rmd` script)
```{r read_in_data}
# here::here()
apt <- readRDS(here("data", "apt-data.rds"))
apt <- as_tibble(apt)
head(apt)
```

Filter out participants who did not progress beyond interview
```{r}
apt <- apt %>% filter(status != "rejected")
```

Convert data from long format to wide format
```{r}
apt_wide <- apt %>% 
  select(-comments) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = session,
                     values_from = c(nback_lett:grade_terp))
```

# Plots & correlations
```{r plot-theme}

reduce tibble to just independent variables:
``` {r reduce_tibble}
# apt <- select(apt, -session, -group, -ppt, -copy_score, -srt_score, -town_map, -bsl_grade)
```

filter out rows with incomplete data
``` {r filter_rows}
#apt_reduced <- filter(apt, corsi_corr != "na")
#apt_reduced <- filter(apt_reduced, nback_spat != "na")
#apt_reduced <- filter(apt_reduced, kirk_ceil != "na")
```

reduce to just four tasks that were done at all 3 sessions
```{r}
#apt_reduced <- select(apt_reduced, nback_lett:kbit_acc)
```

## FA using psych package

```{r }
# fapsych <- fa(apt_reduced, nfactors=3, rotate="oblimin", scores="regression", residuals=FALSE, fm="minres")
```

## run factor analysis
``` {r}
# FA <- factanal(apt_reduced, factors=2, rotation="varimax", scores="regression")
